![Website Screenshot API](./images/website-screenshot-api.png)

In this blog post, I describe the steps I took to set up this API, let's dive in!

<!-- truncate -->

## Puppeteer

[Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) is a node package that allows you to control a headless chrome browser using Javascript. A headless chrome browser is just a browser without a window.

I can use this package to spin up a headless chrome instance, navigate to a website and take a screenshot.

To start Iâ€™m going to create a local node project and install the puppeteer package.

```bash
npm init
npm install puppeteer
```

Now I can create a file called `index.js` and add the following code.

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

takeScreenshot()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Screenshot taken');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Error occured!');
    console.dir(err);
  });

async function takeScreenshot() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://medium.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});

  const buffer = await page.screenshot({
    path: './screenshot.png',
  });

  await page.close();
  await browser.close();
}
```

Note that I am making the `takeScreenshot()` function `async`. This way I can use the await keyword in the function to wait for all the promises.

After running the code I get the following screenshot! ðŸŽ‰

## Google Cloud Functions

So I now have a local script that I can call to take a screenshot, but I want to build an API. The next logical step is to put this script on a server somewhere.

I donâ€™t want to worry about my server running out of memory, so Iâ€™m going to put it on [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/). This way it can handle a huge number of requests without me having to worry about buying more RAM memory.

Once I have the cloud function running, I can call it with an HTTP request â€” meaning that I will have a working screenshot API ðŸš€

Letâ€™s port the previous code to the Google Cloud Function format. The cloud function I created is `async` and called `run()`.

So far I have a working screenshot API. But Iâ€™m going to extend it by uploading the screenshots directly to Google Storage.

Iâ€™m going to use the `@google-cloud/storage` npm package for this. Note that I have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket called `screenshot-api` checkout [this page](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstart-console) for how to set up a storage bucket.

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const {Storage} = require('@google-cloud/storage');

const GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID = 'portfolio-umut-yildirim';
const BUCKET_NAME = 'screenshot-jobs-portfolio-umut-yildirim';

exports.run = async (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json');

  try {
    const buffer = await takeScreenshot(req.body);

    let screenshotUrl = await uploadToGoogleCloud(
      buffer,
      req.body.name + '.png',
    );

    res.status(200).send(
      JSON.stringify({
        screenshotUrl: screenshotUrl,
      }),
    );
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(422).send(
      JSON.stringify({
        error: error.message,
      }),
    );
  }
};

async function uploadToGoogleCloud(buffer, filename) {
  const storage = new Storage({
    projectId: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID,
  });

  const bucket = storage.bucket(BUCKET_NAME);

  const file = bucket.file(filename);
  await uploadBuffer(file, buffer, filename);

  await file.makePublic();

  return `https://${BUCKET_NAME}.storage.googleapis.com/${filename}`;
}

async function takeScreenshot(params) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox'],
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(params.url, {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});

  const buffer = await page.screenshot();

  await page.close();
  await browser.close();

  return buffer;
}

async function uploadBuffer(file, buffer, filename) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    file.save(buffer, {destination: filename}, () => {
      resolve();
    });
  });
}
```

The new result â€” My postman client is showing the URL to the screenshot ðŸš€

Note that in the code above each screenshot is saved as screenshot.png on Google Storage. In the real world, you would need to generate a random id for each image.

## Conclusion

Hereâ€™s the source of a [Google Cloud function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) that, using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), takes a screenshot of a given website and store the resulting screenshot in a bucket on Google Cloud Storage. This was a fun project to do.

You can find the source code of the completed [Google Cloud function](https://gist.github.com/umuthopeyildirim/f2e970cc8ee394de3f58c7a72da0f835) and [package.json](https://gist.github.com/umuthopeyildirim/b19cdf20c40b84d39e6618f6e6db2531) here.

Thanks for reading!
