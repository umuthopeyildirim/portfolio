        <p>
          This paper investigates the RWKV model's efficacy in content
          moderation through targeted experimentation. We introduce a novel
          dataset specifically designed for distillation into smaller models,
          enhancing content moderation practices. This comprehensive dataset
          encompasses images, videos, sounds, and text data that present
          societal challenges. Leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
          we generated an extensive set of responses -- 558,958 for text and
          83,625 for images -- to train and refine content moderation systems.
          Our core experimentation involved fine-tuning the RWKV model,
          capitalizing on its CPU-efficient architecture to address large-scale
          content moderation tasks. By highlighting the dataset's potential for
          knowledge distillation, this study not only demonstrates RWKV's
          capability in improving the accuracy and efficiency of content
          moderation systems but also paves the way for developing more compact,
          resource-efficient models in this domain.

          The problem? Transformers Attention are reaching their limits.
          Competing on training with GPT-4 or BloombergGPT for finance is just
          unfeasible for startups or individuals, since costs are in the
          magnitude of millions. Fin-RWKV is a fine-tuned version of RWKV that
          was fine-tuned on the finance-alpaca dataset for a few dollars in a
          few hours. This can be used to answer user prompts along with
          real-time data aggregated by MindsDB, like OpenBB, vector DBs, or
          internal datasets.

          This project is was initially intended to focus more on the backend
          than the frontend, so that we could try to keep the React side of
          things relatively simple, but thanks to one of our engineers here at
          MindGarden, not only did he help to build a beautiful backend, but he
          single handedly tackled all of the frontend work on his own and the
          outcome was simply amazing. This gave the rest of the team time to
          master our newly consumed knowledge about Ruby while creating an
          amazing back end.

          database will be accessed and stored by a separate React frontend that
          uses the API to communicate with the database.

          MyPass Manager is a simple password manager that uses the MyPass API
          to store your passwords.
        </p>
        <h4>Installation</h4>
        <p>
          MyPass Manager uses Firebase for backend stuff, so you need to create
          a Firebase project and add your project api key to .env file. You can
          find the api key in your Firebase project settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, you need to install the dependencies and run the project.
        </p>
        <code>yarn install && yarn start</code>

        <h4>

        <h4>1- Problem</h4>
        <p>
          As it is known, life has come to a standstill due to the COVID-19
          virus. In the first place, educational opportunities deteriorated. No
          matter how intertwined the students are with technology, they cannot
          use the devices they have efficiently. For this reason, the
          opportunities offered to students are not efficient. If this problem
          is not prevented, we will regress rather than develop as long as
          COVID-19 continues.
        </p>
        <h4>2- Solution</h4>
        <p>
          Educatory is a personalized education tool. With a comprehensive
          Kindergarten-12th curriculum, personalized guidance, and real-time
          analytics, Educatory meets the unique needs of each student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Educatory offers a learning method without rote learning. Not by
          watching videos or looking at the solution of questions, but by
          listening to Educatory's suggestions, students become focused and
          learn the subjects by getting rid of the memorization method.
        </p>
        <h4>3- Setup</h4>
        <p>Start a PHP web server and run the project.</p>
        <p>No additonal setup is required!</p>

        <h4>1- Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Considering that we use the roads in the cities we live in, we all
          deal with potholes on a daily basis. Between 50% and 70% of the roads
          in big cities such as Ä°stanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir and Adana are used in a
          damaged state. On average, slightly more than 50 thousand drivers a
          year in Turkey experience a problem related to potholes. It could be
          anything; puncture of the tire can lead to the bending of the rim and
          deterioration of the shock absorber. The financial cost of the repair
          of these damages reaches up to approximately 1 billion Turkish liras
          in Turkey. Beyond a financial hardship, potholes can cause a variety
          of accidents and problems even for the most experienced drivers. About
          one-fifth of the 7,000 annual traffic deaths are due to poor roads.
          Since the recycling rate of spare parts of these vehicles is less than
          1%, the precaution that can be taken is to prevent these damages and
          losses.
        </p>
        <h4>2- Solution</h4>
        <p>
          Our solution is simple, thanks to the camera connected to the
          Raspberry Pi, the video of the vehicle is recorded along the way. Then
          this video is classified by deep learning. The detected pit is sent to
          the website along with the picture and GPS coordinate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, when the pit is detected and approved, the road is connected to
          the municipality to repair the pit. We report to the relevant
          department of the municipality. This system also analyzes the road
          defect and road condition and warns the municipality when it should be
          repaired. In this way, the municipality both saves money and minimizes
          material and moral damage to the environment.
        </p>
        <h4>3- How it works</h4>
        <p>
          After Raspberry Pi records the road image and gps coordinates, it
          splits the road image frame by frame into hours, minutes and seconds.
          Each frame is saved to the device as a picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every image is converted to OpenCV format. Although Raspberry Pi is a
          very efficient computer. It's not a powerful computer. Two kinds of
          Computer Vision algorithms are used. These are commonly used in Image
          Classification and Object Detection. However, Object Detection is not
          strong enough to run on Raspberry Pi, I could get a maximum of 3-4
          FPS. So I used Image Classification. I uploaded and marked my dataset
          with Azure Cognitive Services. After the model training is finished,
          Image Classification deep learning application can work with sample
          codes and Tensorflow documentation.
        </p>
        <h4>4- Setup</h4>
        <p>Follow the codes with Python3.</p>
        <code>$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>
        <br></br>
        <code>$ python3 main.py</code>

        <h4>
          <br></br>5- In the Future
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The dataset is not very comprehensive, it covers Turkey's 2-4 km
            long street roads. So a larger dataset may be efficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is possible to use a more powerful computer to increase the speed
            of the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since I don't have a GPS device, even if I wrote the function, it
            needs to be rewritten and tested.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's not a package software but can be translated easily. If it is
            production software, it can be coded as a startup as soon as the
            tool is running.
          </li>
          <li>Main.py can be overhauled.</li>
